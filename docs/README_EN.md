During my daily work, some APKs packaged prompted ‚Äúno signature‚Äù when fortified by 360, but the signing process
provided by 360 fortification is too cumbersome, so this small tool was developed to sign APK files via GUI.

This software is based on JetBrains Compose Multiplatform and supports macOS, Windows, and Linux.

My daily development is mainly based on macOS, so there may be some compatibility issues on Windows and Linux that have
not yet been discovered. If you find such problems,
please [let me know](https://github.com/jixiaoyong/ApkSigner/issues), I will try to adapt as much as possible. You are
also very welcome to submit [PR](https://github.com/jixiaoyong/ApkSigner/pulls).

## Main Features

This APP is to facilitate you to operate the signing of APK through the graphical interface, support the management,
switching of multiple signatures, and one-click signing of APK, etc. The tool does not provide the function of
generating signature files. To use this tool, you need to prepare the following content in advance:

* **Signature file**, generally `.keystore` or `.jks` format file, used to sign APK
* **apksigner and zipalign files**, used to sign and align APK, generally in the `build-tools` folder of a certain
  version
  in Android SDK
* **Java development environment**, the apksigner for signing APK needs to read the `JAVA_HOME` configuration

üöß The interface function is still being developing, and the basic function is available:

- [x] Add / Delete / Switch signature information (will only modify the APP's own configuration, will not modify your
  files)
- [x] Sign APK file, support V1, V2, V3, V4 scheme
- [x] Specify the output directory of the signed APK
- [x] View the existing signature information of APK
- [x] Support Light and Dark themes, and can switch automatically
- [x] Optional alignment or not
- [x] Support multi-file signature, view signature
- [ ] Import multiple signature files
- [x] Automatically save/match the signature information corresponding to APK
- [ ] Optimize signature configuration
- [x] Beautify the theme
- [ ] Add view log function
- [x] Support international languages, can automatically recognize system language

For privacy considerations, this APP will not add online update detection function. If you want to get the latest
version of the information, you can star or watch this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/jixiaoyong/ApkSigner),
so that when the APP is updated, GitHub will notify you on the homepage or by email.
